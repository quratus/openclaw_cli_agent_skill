## How the skill invokes the Kimi CLI

The skill runs the Kimi CLI via Node.js `child_process.spawn()`, **not** a shell:

- **No shell:** The prompt is passed as a single element in the `args` array to `spawn(cmd, args, options)`. The operating system passes it as one argument to the `kimi` process. There is no `execSync('kimi -p "' + prompt + '"')` or similar; therefore there is no shell command injection at this layer.
- **Input sanitization:** Before calling the CLI, the prompt is sanitized:
  - Null bytes (`\0`) are removed (they could truncate arguments in C-style parsers).
  - Other C0 control characters (except tab, newline, carriage return) are replaced with spaces to avoid control sequences that could confuse downstream parsers.
- **Trust boundary:** The skill does not store or log credentials. It only verifies that the user has already authenticated the Kimi CLI; the CLI runs with the user’s privileges in the configured worktree.

## RCE / argument injection

The ClawHub finding concerns possible RCE if the Kimi CLI were susceptible to argument or command injection. On the skill side:

1. We never invoke a shell; we use `spawn` with an argument array.
2. We sanitize the prompt (null bytes and control characters) before passing it as the `-p` argument.
3. The Kimi CLI is a dependency run by the user; we recommend keeping it updated. Any vulnerability inside the Kimi CLI itself would need to be addressed by its maintainers.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please open an issue on the [repository](https://github.com/quratus/openclaw_cli_agent_skill) or contact the maintainers privately.

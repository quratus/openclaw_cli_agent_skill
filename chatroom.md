- **Auto (pen test + fixes)** — 2026-02-19: Security audit on cli-worker repo. Fixed: (1) **Shell injection** in `worktree/create.ts`: `git worktree add` was run via `execSync` string (shell); switched to `spawnSync("git", [...args])` and added `isSafeTaskId(taskId)`. (2) **SECURITY.md** updated with git worktree section and npm audit note (devDeps only; published package has zero runtime deps). (3) Unit tests for `createWorktree` rejecting invalid taskId. npm audit still reports devDependency vulns (eslint/minimatch/ajv); no override applied so lint keeps working. 86 unit tests, lint, integration pass.
- **Auto (plan verification + status fix)** — 2026-02-18: Checked multi-provider implementation against the plan. Build, lint, and all 83 unit + 2 integration tests pass. Fixed: `cli-worker status <taskId>` previously hardcoded `kimi-reports`; now accepts optional `--provider kimi|claude|opencode` and uses that provider’s report subdir so status works for Claude/OpenCode tasks. README and main help updated. Safe to push to GitHub.
- **CLI Worker Skill** – Sprint 0–6 and 8 implemented. Repo: `openclaw_cli_agent_skill/`. Run `npm run build && npm test`; `cli-worker --help` for CLI. SKILL.md in `skills/cli-worker/`. (Mon Feb 16 2026)
